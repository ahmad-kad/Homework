# Steps
First establish what anagrams will include
- two strings must have the same length and same count for each character
- each character Uppercase and Lowercase will be treated separately since its not defined

## Implementation
create the obvious case where length of string 's' != string 't' so that it exits
create two hashmaps, one for string 's' and string 't'.
compare two hashmaps to return True or False based on condition
